<h1>African Economy Analysis</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project presents an analysis of layoffs from companies around the world, with a focus on the number of layoffs, affected industries, and regional trends. The dashboard aggregates data from major companies, providing insights into geographical patterns, layoff severity (total number of affected employees), and industry-specific layoffs over time. By tracking layoffs, this tool enables organizations and policymakers to understand the broader economic impact, identify trends in workforce reduction, and anticipate possible future shifts in the job market.
